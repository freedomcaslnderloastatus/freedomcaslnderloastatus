Most states permit lenders to charge borrowers a fee to cover the cost of originating a loan, and some allow additional fees, such as monthly maintenance, recording, and administrative. In the contracts Pew analyzed, lenders generally charged the maximum allowed under state law, with origination fees and related charges ranging from 1 to 46 percent of loan proceeds for loans under $1,500.64 One reason for this substantial variation is that some state regulations allow fees in fixed-amount terms rather than as a percentage of the amount financed. Therefore, those fees can represent a disproportionately large share for small loans. For example, Louisiana lenders can charge $50 origination and $10 documentation fees for any loan under $3,000;65 thus a $130 loan contract reviewed by Pew carried fees that amounted to 46 percent of the proceeds. Those same fees would be just 6 percent of a $1,000 loan.
